# Embedded Thermometer Project  

##  Overview  
A *digital thermometer system* designed using microcontrollers and sensors. Developed as part of my Embedded Systems coursework at KNUST to demonstrate real-time temperature monitoring.  

##  Features  
- Real-time temperature readings  
- Microcontroller + digital sensor integration  
- KiCad schematic and PCB design  
- Extendable to IoT for remote monitoring  

##  Technologies  
- C (Microcontroller programming)  
- KiCad, Proteus  
- Arduino/ATmega, LM35/DS18B20 sensor
